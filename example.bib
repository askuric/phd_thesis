abstract = {This introduction to robotics offers a distinct and unified perspective of the mechanics, planning and control of robots. Ideal for self-learning, or for courses, as it assumes only freshman-level physics, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra and a little bit of computing background. Modern Robotics presents the state-of-the-art, screw-theoretic techniques capturing the most salient physical features of a robot in an intuitive geometrical way. With numerous exercises at the end of each chapter, accompanying software written to reinforce the concepts in the book and video lectures aimed at changing the classroom experience, this is the go-to textbook for learning about this fascinating subject.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of suppressing sloshing dynamics in liquid handling robotic systems by an appropriate design of position/orientation trajectories. Specifically, a dynamic system, i.e. the exponential filter, is used to filter the desired trajectory for the liquid-filled vessel moved by the robot and counteract the sloshing effect. To this aim, the vessel has been modelled as a spherical pendulum of proper mass/length subject to the accelerations imposed by the robot and the problem has been approached in terms of vibration suppression to cancel the residual oscillations of the pendulum, i.e. the pendulum swing at the end of the reference rest-to-rest motion. In addition, in order to reduce the relative motion between liquid and vessel, an orientation compensation mechanism has been devised aiming to maintain the vessel aligned with the pendulum during the motion. The effectiveness of the proposed approach, both in simple point-to-point motions and complex multi-point trajectories, has been proved by means of an exhaustive set of experimental tests on an industrial manipulator that moves a cylindrical vessel filled with water. This innovative solution effectively uses all the degrees of freedom of the robotic manipulator to successfully suppress sloshing, thus significantly improving the performances of the robotic system. Furthermore, the proposed solution, showing a high degree of robustness as well as intrinsic design simplicity, is very promising for designing novel industrial robotics applications with a short time-to-market across key manufacturing sectors (e.g., food and beverage, among others).}

	abstract = {Resolved-rate motion control of redundant seriallink manipulators is commonly achieved using the MoorePenrose pseudoinverse in which the norm of the control input is minimized. However, as kinematic singularities are a signiﬁcant issue for robotic manipulators, we propose a Manipulability Motion Controller which chooses joint velocities which will also increase the manipulability of the robot. The manipulability measure has a complex non-linear relationship with the robot’s joint conﬁguration and in this paper we derive the manipulability Jacobian which directly relates joint velocities to the rate of change of manipulability. Furthermore, we use the manipulability Jacobian within a constrained quadratic program to create an improved resolved-rate motion controller for redundant robots. The resulting real-time controller provides joint velocities which achieve a desired Cartesian end-effector velocity while also maximising the robot’s manipulability. We illustrate and verify our control scheme on several popular seriallink manipulators and provide an open-source library which implements our controller (available at jhavl.github.io/mmc).},

Generally, these measures examine the system’s kinematic transformations from configuration to task space. This means that environmental constraints are neglected in spite of the significant effects they may have on the robot’s admissible motions. In this paper, we propose a new measure called the constrained manipulability polytope (CMP) that considers the system’s kinematic structure, including closed chains or composite sub-mechanisms, joint limits and the presence of obstacles. For an illustrative planar case, we demonstrate how the CMP can evaluate a robot’s performance in a cluttered scene and how this evaluation can be extrapolated to obtain a workspace visualization. Additionally, we show the advantages and limitations of the CMP compared to the state of the art. Furthermore, the method is demonstrated both in simulation and experimentally for NASA’s Valkyrie robot. We show how the CMP provides a measure for single-arm and dual-arm manipulation tasks, analyze the workspace and be used to optimize the robot’s posture.},

Given the nominal torques required by a dynamic motion, this representation models the forces which can be sustained without interfering with that motion. The residual force polytope can be used to analyze and compare the set of admissible forces of diﬀerent trajectories, but it can also be used to deﬁne metrics for solving optimization problems, such as in trajectory optimization or system design. We demonstrate how such a metric can be applied to trajectory optimization and compare it against other objective functions typically used. Our results show that the trajectories computed by optimizing objectives deﬁned as functions of the residual force polytope are more robust to unknown external disturbances. The computational cost of these metrics is relatively high and not compatible with the short planning times required by online methods, but they are acceptable for planning motions oﬄine.},

	abstract = {Recently, industrial robots are being more and more widely used in a variety of machining applications, such as drilling, milling and grinding because of their ﬂexibility in performing tasks in a relatively small space, and furthermore, at a lower cost. In many cases, the wrench capability of industrial robots is lower than the required, causing in some tasks the saturation of the joints. The possibility of using two or more robots to perform a given task increases the wrench capability, allowing us to workout in applications which are impossible to solve by using only one manipulator. A Cooperative Robotic System (CRS) increases the ﬂexibility in the performance of tasks allowing a more homogeneous distribution of the forces generated during the interaction between the end-effector and the environment. In some cases, the CRS can be composed by robots with different capabilities, and a strategy for wrench distribution must be used. Recent works presented the force capability analysis using an scaling factor method for single serial robots. This paper proposes the use of this scaling factor method in CRS, seeking to obtain a balance of forces between the robots. The proposed method is discussed and graphical results are presented.},

An example is robotic rehabilitation in which the assistance-as-needed (AAN) paradigm aims to provide operators with the minimum assistance required to perform the task. Current approaches use empirical performance-based methods which require repeated observation of the specific task before an estimate of the needed assistance can be determined. In this paper, we present a new approach utilizing a musculoskeletal model (MM) of the upper limb to estimate the operator's assistance needs with respect to physical tasks. With capabilities of the operator defined at the muscular level of the MM, an optimization model is used to estimate the operator's strength capability. Strength required to perform a task is calculated using a task model. The difference or gap between the operator's strength capability and the strength required to execute a task forms the basis for the new AAN paradigm. We show how this approach estimates the effects of limb pose, load direction, and muscle impairments on a person's ability to perform tasks.},

	abstract = {Developing formalisms to determine force capabilities of human limbs by using musculoskeletal models could be useful for biomechanical and ergonomic applications. In this framework, the purpose of this study was to compare measured maximal isometric force capabilities at the hand in a set of Cartesian directions with forces computed from a musculoskeletal model of the upper-limb. The results were represented under the form of a measured force polytope (MFP) and a musculoskeletal force polytope (MSFP). Both of them were obtained from the convex hull of measured and simulated force vectors endpoints. Nine subjects participated to the experiment. For one posture recorded with an optoelectronic system, maximum isometric forces exerted at the hand were recorded in twenty six directions of the Cartesian space with a triaxial force sensor. Results showed significant differences between the polytopes global shapes. The MSFP was more elongated than the MFP. Concerning the polytopes volumes, no significant difference was found. Mean maximal isometric forces provided by MFP and MSFP were 509.6 (118.4)N and 627.9 (73.3)N respectively. Moreover, the angle between the main axes of the two polytopes was 5.5 (2.3)° on average. Finally, RMS error values between MFP and MSFP were lower than 100N in 88\% of the considered directions. The proposed MSFP based on a musculoskeletal model gave interesting information on optimal force orientation parameters. The possible applications in the frame of ergonomics, rehabilitation and biomechanics are proposed and discussed.},

This paper focuses on n-DOF CDPRs driven by n+2 cables since, for n = 6, these redundantly actuated CDPRs are relevant in many applications. The set of feasible cable tensions of n-DOF n+2-cable CDPRs is a two-dimensional convex polygon. An algorithm that determines the vertices of this polygon in a clockwise or counterclockwise order is ﬁrst introduced. This algorithm is efﬁcient and can deal with infeasibility. It is then pointed out that straightforward modiﬁcations of this algorithm allow the determination of various (optimal) cable tension distributions. A self-contained and versatile tension distribution algorithm is thereby obtained. Moreover, the worst-case maximum number of iterations of this algorithm is established. Based on this result, its computational cost is analyzed in detail, showing that the algorithm is efﬁcient and real-time compatible even in the worst case. Finally, experiments on two 6-DOF 8-cable CDPR prototypes are reported.},

The aim of the grasp stability analysis is to find the resistance forces and moments of robot hands that can withstand the external disturbance forces and moments applied on objects. We calculate the resistance forces and moments respectively which are considered the properties of objects and robots. Therefore, the resistance forces and moments depend on the joint driving torque limits, the posture and the mass of robot fingers, the configuration and the mass of objects, the grasp position, the friction coefficients between the object surface and the end-effectors of robot fingers. We produce the critical resistance force and moment which are absolutely stable about external disturbances in all directions, the global resistance force and moment which are whole grasp capability of robot hands, and the weighted resistance forces and moments which can be properly used by controlling two indices according to the importance of robot hands. The effectiveness of this method is verified with simulation examples.},

Manipulation planning is introduced as an extension to the basic motion planning problem, which can be modeled as a hybrid system of continuous configuration spaces arising from the act of grasping and moving parts in the environment. The important example of assembly motion is discussed through the analysis of contact states and compliant motion control.

To this end, the fundamental nature of the available wrench set is studied. The latter concept, defined here, is closely related to similar sets introduced by Ebert-Uphoff and co-workers (2004, “Force-Feasible Workspace Analysis for Underconstrained, Point-Mass Cable Robots,” IEEE Trans.

Autom., 5, pp. 4956–4962; 2007, “Workspace Optimization of a Very Large Cable-Driven Parallel Mechanism for a Radiotelescope Application,” Proceedings of the ASME IDETC/CIE Mechanics and Robotics Conference, Las Vegas, NV). It is shown that the available wrench set can be represented mathematically by a zonotope, a special class of convex polytopes. Using the properties of zonotopes, two methods to construct the available wrench set are discussed. From the representation of the available wrench set, computationally efficient and noniterative tests are presented to verify if this set includes the task wrench set, the set of wrenches needed for a given task.},

	Abstract = {Skeletal muscles transform neural control signals into forces that act upon the body segments to effect a coordinated motor task. This transformation is complex, not only because the properties of muscles are complex, but because the tendon affects the transmission of muscle force to the skeleton. This review focuses on how to synthesize basic properties of muscle and tendon to construct models applicable to studies of coordination. After a review of the properties of muscle and tendon, their integrated ability to generate force statically and dynamically is studied by formulating a generic model of the "musculotendon actuator", which has only one parameter, the ratio of tendon length at rest to muscle fiber length at rest. To illustrate the utility of the model, it is analyzed to show how this one parameter specifies whether excitation-contraction or musculotendon contraction is the rate-limiting process of force generation, whether elastic energy is stored in tendon or muscle, and whether hip- and knee-extensor actuators function as springs or dashpots during walking.},

    abstract = {The proposition that dynamic optimization provides better estimates of muscle forces during gait than static optimization is examined by comparing a dynamic solution with two static solutions. A 23-degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model actuated by 54 Hill-type musculotendon units was used to simulate one cycle of normal gait. The dynamic problem was to find the muscle excitations which minimized metabolic energy per unit distance traveled, and which produced a repeatable gait cycle. In the dynamic problem, activation dynamics was described by a first-order differential equation. The joint moments predicted by the dynamic solution were used as input to the static problems. In each static problem, the problem was to find the muscle activations which minimized the sum of muscle activations squared, and which generated the joint moments input from the dynamic solution. In the first static problem, muscles were treated as ideal force generators; in the second, they were constrained by their force–length–velocity properties; and in both, activation dynamics was neglected. In terms of predicted muscle forces and joint contact forces, the dynamic and static solutions were remarkably similar. Also, activation dynamics and the force–length–velocity properties of muscle had little influence on the static solutions. Thus, for normal gait, if one can accurately solve the inverse dynamics problem and if one seeks only to estimate muscle forces, the use of dynamic optimization rather than static optimization is currently not justified. Scenarios in which the use of dynamic optimization is justified are suggested.}

Generic and scaled-generic parameters may be quickly and easily employed, but these approaches do not account for an individual subject’s joint torque capacity. The objective of the present study was to develop a subject-specific experimental testing and modeling framework to evaluate shoulder muscle and joint function during activities of daily living, and to assess the capacity of generic and scaled-generic musculotendon parameters to predict muscle and joint function. Three-dimensional musculoskeletal models of the shoulders of 6 healthy subjects were developed to calculate muscle and glenohumeral joint loading during abduction, flexion, horizontal flexion, nose touching and reaching using subject-specific, scaled-generic and generic musculotendon parameters. Muscle and glenohumeral joint forces calculated using generic and scaled-generic models were significantly different to those of subject-specific models (p<0.05), and task dependent; however, scaled-generic model calculations of shoulder glenohumeral joint force demonstrated better agreement with those of subject-specific models during abduction and flexion. Muscles in generic musculoskeletal models operated further from the plateau of their force–length curves than those of scaled-generic and subject-specific models, while muscles in subject-specific models operated over a wider region of their force length curves than those of the generic or scaled-generic models, reflecting diversity of subject shoulder strength. The findings of this study suggest that generic and scaled-generic musculotendon parameters may not provide sufficient accuracy in prediction of shoulder muscle and joint loading when compared to models that employ subject-specific parameter-estimation approaches.}

ABSTRACT = {A force capacity evaluation for a given posture may provide better understanding of human motor abilities for applications in sport sciences, rehabilitation and ergonomics. From data on posture and maximum isometric joint torques, the upper-limb force feasible set of the hand was predicted by four models called force ellipsoid, scaled force ellipsoid, force polytope and scaled force polytope, which were compared with a measured force polytope. The volume, shape and force prediction errors were assessed. The scaled ellipsoid underestimated the maximal mean force, and the scaled polytope overestimated it. The scaled force ellipsoid underestimated the volume of the measured force distribution, whereas that of the scaled polytope was not significantly different from the measured distribution but exhibited larger variability. All the models characterized well the elongated shape of the measured force distribution. The angles between the main axes of the modelled ellipsoids and polytopes and that of the measured polytope were compared. The values ranged from 7.3° to 14.3°. Over the entire surface of the force ellipsoid, 39.7\% of the points had prediction errors less than 50 N; 33.6\% had errors between 50 and 100 N; and 26.8\% had errors greater than 100 N. For the force polytope, the percentages were 56.2\%, 28.3\% and 15.4\%, respectively.},

   ABSTRACT={This paper introduces a novel control framework for an arm exoskeleton that takes into account force of the human arm. In contrast to the conventional exoskeleton controllers where the assistance is provided without considering the human arm biomechanical force manipulability properties, we propose a control approach based on the arm muscular manipulability. The proposed control framework essentially reshapes the anisotropic force manipulability into the endpoint force manipulability that is invariant with respect to the direction in the entire workspace of the arm. This allows users of the exoskeleton to perform tasks effectively in the whole range of the workspace, even in areas that are normally unsuitable due to the low force manipulability of the human arm. We evaluated the proposed control framework with real robot experiments where subjects wearing an arm exoskeleton were asked to move a weight between several locations. The results show that the proposed control framework does not affect the normal movement behavior of the users while effectively reduces user effort in the area of low manipulability. Particularly, the proposed approach augments the human arm force manipulability to execute tasks equally well in the entire workspace of the arm.}

abstract = {Musculoskeletal computer models are often used to study muscle function in children with and without impaired mobility. Calculations of muscle forces depend in part on the assumed strength of each muscle, represented by the peak isometric force parameter, which is usually based on measurements obtained from cadavers of adult donors. The aim of the present study was twofold: first, to develop a method for scaling lower-limb peak isometric muscle forces in typically-developing children; and second, to determine the effect of this scaling method on model calculations of muscle forces obtained for normal gait. Muscle volumes were determined from magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained from ten children aged from 7 to 13yr. A new mass–length scaling law was developed based on the assumption that muscle volume and body mass are linearly related, which was confirmed by the obtained volume and body mass data. Two musculoskeletal models were developed for each subject: one in which peak isometric muscle forces were estimated using the mass–length scaling law; and another in which these parameters were determined directly from the MR-derived muscle volumes. Musculoskeletal modeling and quantitative gait analysis were then used to calculate lower-limb muscle forces in normal walking. The patterns of muscle forces predicted by the model with scaled peak isometric force values were similar to those predicted by the MR-based model, implying that assessments of muscle function obtained from these two methods are practically equivalent. These results support the use of mass–length scaling in the development of subject-specific musculoskeletal models of children.}

Our objective was to systematically study how the number of kinematic degrees of freedom, and the number of independent muscle actuators alter the robustness of motor output to muscle dysfunction. We took a detailed musculoskeletal model of the human leg and systematically varied the model complexity to create six models with either 3 or 7 kinematic degrees of freedom and either 14, 26, or 43 muscle actuators. We tested the redundancy of each model by quantifying the reduction in sagittal plane feasible force set area when a single muscle was removed. The robustness of feasible force set area to the loss of any single muscle, i.e. general single muscle loss increased with the number of independent muscles and decreased with the number of kinematic degrees of freedom, with the robust area varying from 1% and 52% of the intact feasible force set area. The maximum sensitivity of the feasible force set to the loss of any single muscle varied from 75% to 26% of the intact feasible force set area as the number of muscles increased. Additionally, the ranges of feasible muscle activation for maximum force production were largely unconstrained in many cases, indicating ample musculoskeletal redundancy even for maximal forces. We propose that ratio of muscles to kinematic degrees of freedom can be used as a rule of thumb for estimating musculoskeletal redundancy in both simulated and real biomechanical systems.},

abstract = { It has been shown that in human-robot interaction, the effectiveness of a robot varies inversely with the operator engagement in the task. Given the importance of maintaining optimal task engagement when working with a robot, it would be immensely useful to have a robotic system that can detect the level of operator engagement and modify its behavior if required. This paper presents a framework for human-robot interaction that allows inference of operator's engagement level through the analysis of his/her physiological signals, and adaptation of robot behavior as a function of the operator's engagement level. Peripheral physiological signals were measured through wearable biofeedback sensors and a control architecture inspired by Riley's original information-flow model was developed to implement such human-robot interaction. The results from affect-elicitation tasks for human participants showed that it was possible to detect engagement through physiological sensing in real-time. An open-loop teleoperation-based robotic experiment was also conducted where the recorded physiological signals were transmitted to the robot in real-time speed to demonstrate that the presented control architecture allowed the robot to adapt its behavior based on operator engagement level. }

abstract = {Adaptive automation is an approach to automation design where tasks are dynamically allocated between the human operator and computer systems. Psychophysiology has two complementary roles in research on adaptive automation: first, to provide information about the effects of different forms of automation thus promoting the development of effective adaptive logic; and second, psychophysiology may yield information about the operator that can be integrated with performance measurement and operator modelling to aid in the regulation of automation. This review discusses the basic tenets of adaptive automation and the role of psychophysiological measures in the study of adaptive automation. Empirical results from studies of flight simulation are presented. Psychophysiological measures may prove especially useful in the prevention of performance deterioration in underload conditions that may accompany automation. Individual differences and the potential for learned responses require research to understand their influence on adaptive algorithms. Adaptive automation represents a unique domain for the application of psychophysiology in the work environment.}

    abstract = {Much debate has arisen from research on muscle synergies with respect to both limb impedance control and energy consumption. Studies of limb impedance control in the context of reaching movements and postural tasks have produced divergent findings, and this study explores whether the use of synergies by the central nervous system (CNS) can resolve these findings and also provide insights on mechanisms of energy consumption. In this study, we phrase these debates at the conceptual level of interactions between neural degrees of freedom and tasks constraints. This allows us to examine the ability of experimentally-observed synergies—correlated muscle activations—to control both energy consumption and the stiffness component of limb endpoint impedance. In our nominal 6-muscle planar arm model, muscle synergies and the desired size, shape, and orientation of endpoint stiffness ellipses, are expressed as linear constraints that define the set of feasible muscle activation patterns. Quadratic programming allows us to predict whether and how energy consumption can be minimized throughout the workspace of the limb given those linear constraints. We show that the presence of synergies drastically decreases the ability of the CNS to vary the properties of the endpoint stiffness and can even preclude the ability to minimize energy. Furthermore, the capacity to minimize energy consumption—when available—can be greatly affected by arm posture. Our computational approach helps reconcile divergent findings and conclusions about task-specific regulation of endpoint stiffness and energy consumption in the context of synergies. But more generally, these results provide further evidence that the benefits and disadvantages of muscle synergies go hand-in-hand with the structure of feasible muscle activation patterns afforded by the mechanics of the limb and task constraints. These insights will help design experiments to elucidate the interplay between synergies and the mechanisms of learning, plasticity, versatility and pathology in neuromuscular systems.},

journal={Biological Cybernetics},

volume={72},
number={6},
pages={475-485},
abstract={The present paper examines human hand impedance characteristics, including inertia and viscosity as well as stiffness, in multi-joint arm movements. While a subject maintains a given hand location, small external disturbances are applied to his hand by a manipulandum. The corresponding force-displacement vectors are measured and sampled over time in order to estimate the hand impedance by means of a second-order linear model. The experimental results in different subjects and hand locations are summarized as follows: (1) the estimated inertia matrices of the human hand well agrees with computed values using a twojoint arm model, (2) spatial variations of the stiffness ellipses are consistent with the experimental results of Mussa-Ivaldi et al. (1985), (3) hand stiffness and viscosity increase with the grip force of the subject, and (4) viscosity and stiffness ellipses tend to have similar orientation. The accuracy of the impedance estimation method is validated with a mechanical spring-mass system with known parameters.},

The overall model is a coupling of models that define contact behavior with widely used models of rigid-body kinematics and dynamics. The contact model essentially boils down to the selection of components of contact force and moment that are transmitted through each contact. Mathematical properties of the complete model naturally give rise to five primary grasp types whose physical interpretations provide insight for grasp and manipulation planning.",

abstract = {An experimental protocol with five tasks is proposed for a low-cost empirical assessment of the reachable 3-D workspace (RWS), including both close-to-torso and far-from-torso regions. Ten participants repeated the protocol for four distinct hand payloads. The RWS expressed as a point cloud and its non-convex alpha-shape were obtained for each case. Moreover, individual strength surrogates for glenohumeral flexion and abduction, and elbow flexion were collected using a dynamometer. The RWS volume was statistically modelled using payload, body-mass-index and the strength surrogates as predictors. For increasing payload, a significant (r = −0.736,p < 0.001) decrease in RWS volume was found for distinct payload cases across all subjects. The only significant predictors found for the RWS volume were normalized payload (F = 73.740,p < 0.001) and body-mass-index (F = 11.008,p = 0.003). No significant interactions were found. The consequent regression model (F(2,27) = 41.11, p < 0.001, Radj2 = 0.7345) explained around 73% of the variation in the data. The RWS volume is a function of payload and body-mass-index.}

abstract = {Minkowski sum is an important operation. It is used in many domains such as: computer-aided design, robotics, spatial planning, mathematical morphology, and image processing. We propose a novel algorithm, named the Contributing Vertices-based Minkowski Sum (CVMS) algorithm for the computation of the Minkowski sum of convex polyhedra. The CVMS algorithm allows to easily obtain all the facets of the Minkowski sum polyhedron only by examining the contributing vertices—a concept we introduce in this work, for each input facet. We exploit the concept of contributing vertices to propose the Enhanced and Simplified Slope Diagram-based Minkowski Sum (ESSDMS) algorithm, a slope diagram-based Minkowski sum algorithm sharing some common points with the approach proposed by Wu et al. [Wu Y, Shah J, Davidson J. Improvements to algorithms for computing the Minkowski sum of 3-polytopes. Comput Aided Des. 2003; 35(13): 1181–92]. The ESSDMS algorithm does not embed input polyhedra on the unit sphere and does not need to perform stereographic projections. Moreover, the use of contributing vertices brings up more simplifications and improves the overall performance. The implementations for the mentioned algorithms are straightforward, use exact number types, produce exact results, and are based on CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. More examples and results of the CVMS algorithm for several convex polyhedra can be found at http://liris.cnrs.fr/hichem.barki/mksum/CVMS-convex.}

For the intersection, we prove that computing the facets or the vertices of the intersection of two polytopes is NP-hard if one of them is given by vertices and the other by facets. Also, computing the vertices of the intersection of two polytopes given by vertices is shown to be NP-hard. Analogous results for computing the convex hull of the union of two polytopes follow from polar duality. All of the hardness results are established by showing that the appropriate decision version, for each of these problems, is NP-complete.},

More exactly, given a polytope P by a system of linear inequalities, we look for two collections I and E of boxes with non-overlapping interiors such that the union of all boxes in I is contained in P and the union of all boxes in E contains P. We propose and test several techniques to construct I and E aimed at getting a good balance between two contrasting objectives: minimize the volume error and minimize the total number of generated boxes. We suggest how to modify the proposed techniques in order to approximate the projection of P onto a given subspace without computing the projection explicitly.}

ABSTRACT={Cobotic workstations in industrial plants involve a new kind of collaborative robots that can interact with operators. These cobots enable more flexibility and they can reduce the cycle time and the floor space of the workstation. However, cobots also introduce new safety concerns with regard to operators, and they may have an impact on the workstation ergonomics. For those reasons, introducing cobots in a workstation always require additional studies on safety and ergonomics before being applied and certified. Certification rules are often complex to understand. We present the SEEROB framework for the Safety and Ergonomics Evaluation of ROBotic workstations. The SEEROB framework simulates a physics-based digital twin of the cobotic workstation and computes a large panel of criteria used for safety and ergonomics. These criteria may be processed for the certification of the workstation. The SEEROB framework also uses extended reality technologies to display the digital twin and its associated data: users can use virtual reality headsets for the design of non-existing workstations, and mixed reality devices to better understand safety and ergonomics constraints on existing workstations. The SEEROB framework was tested on various laboratory and industrial use cases, involving different kinds of robots.}
