\section{Prospectives}


Visualisation
\todos{
\begin{itemize}
    \item figure out what are the best ways to visualise polytopes
    \item and which metrics
    \item and in which situations
    \item interesting for toleration and shared control
    \item also potentially for safety!
\end{itemize}
}

Physical interaction 
\todos{
\begin{itemize}
    \item robot control strategies combining multiple physical ability polytopes at one (precision and force for example)
    \item task scheduling schemes that take in consideration their abilities
\end{itemize}
}

Motion planning
\todos{
\begin{itemize}
    \item use human polytopes within robot planning (for example velocity)
    \item use MPC to do se
\end{itemize}
}
